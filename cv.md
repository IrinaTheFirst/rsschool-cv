### About me
I'm in my middle-ish thirties. Live in Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I was a school teacher once in my small hometown. Taught children russian language and literature. One day I quit my job and move to SPb. Been here and there, doing stuff, working hard. Well you know just trying my best to live this life like everyone (✿◡‿◡)
Couple years ago I was lucky to study **HTML+CSS** and I liked it so much! I made several landing pages and pare of simple sites. But my knowledges are still so far from good...And I'm ready to learn! I hope one day I will be able to call myself a full-fledged developer!
